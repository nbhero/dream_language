      <p>Hi everyone! I'm Bruno, hope everyone is having an awesome year like I am.</p>
      <p>I'm 25, married and father of two children and looking to get a major degree in Web Development and Computer Programming. RPG games are my passion, but I love spending time watching movies with my family, specially the marvel ones haha.</p>
      <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 16. I had the opportunity to serve on the Japan Fukuoka Mission and learn a lot there from my Mission President and companions</p>
      <p>I work at Magazine Luiza as a Contract Analyst and one of my main goals is to get a promotion to the Labs Department, which is the area where the developers of the company work.</p>
      <p>I believe I will learn a lot from being a BYU Idaho student.</p>
